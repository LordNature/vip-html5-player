## Version 1.0.0
This version is a rewrite of the original HTML5 replacement player by fpgaminer.
The rewrite uses native Javascript instead of jQuery and removes the opinionated
theme for a very minimal one. It also removes the "playlist" feature in favor of
your browser's history as a playlist.

## Version 0.0.46
This version is simply a few patches on-top of the initial fpgaminer version to
put the javascript and css in a separate file. fpgaminer wrote this to replace
the deprecated Flash version. Since its creation, it has been used by the
official site as the [new player](https://vipvgm.net/).
